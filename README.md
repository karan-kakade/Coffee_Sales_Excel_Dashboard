# Coffee_Sales_Excel_Dashboard
I’ve developed a comprehensive coffee sales dashboard in Excel that leverages advanced functions such as XLOOKUP, INDEX, and IF formulas to provide dynamic and insightful data analysis. This project involved crafting a detailed and interactive interface that includes three slicers for enhanced data filtering and visualization. To make the data more accessible and visually appealing, I’ve incorporated 2D bar graphs that highlight the top 5 customers and display sales performance by country.The result is a powerful tool that offers a clear and concise overview of coffee sales data, enabling informed decision-making and strategic planning.
